# Random Color Generator

This project generates a random color each time a button is clicked. The background color of a `div` element and the text displaying the color change dynamically.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: Structure of the page
- **CSS**: Styling for page layout and design
- **JavaScript**: Random color generation and interaction

## Features:
- Click the button to generate a random color.
- The random color is displayed in both the text and the background.
- Responsive design for better user experience.

## How It Works:
1. **HTML**: Defines the button and a text element where the color will be shown.
2. **CSS**: Centers the content and styles the button and `div` element.
3. **JavaScript**:
   - An event listener is added to the button to trigger the color change.
   - A function (`getRandomColor()`) generates random RGB values.
   - These values are used to update the text and background color dynamically.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-usernam/random-color-generator.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
